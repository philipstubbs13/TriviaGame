## How to play
<ul>
	<li>The trivia game includes 10 questions.</li>
	<li>The theme of the game is Super Bowl trivia. So, you might want to brush up on your Super Bowl history before playing.</li>
	<li>To start playing, click <b>Start</b>.</li>
	<li>You have 15 seconds to answer each question. When the timer reaches 0, your time is up, and the game will move to the next question.</li>
	<li>The game counts running out of time on a question as an incorrect answer. So, don't think too much for too long. If you don't know the answer to a question, just guess.</li>
	<li>After you go through all the questions, you will find out your score. If you want, you will have the opportunity to play again to improve that score.</li>
</ul>

## Future feature enhancements 
<ul>
	<li>Replace imageCorrect images with gifs using the giphy API. So, when a user gets a question right, show gif rather than static image.</li>
	<li>Add more questions.</li>
	<li>Replace image on start screen with better image.</li>
	<li>When user gets 100% correct, a gif shows at end of game. Update gif.</li>
</ul>
